## How to Edit

### Profile Image
To add your profile image:
1. Upload your photo (e.g., `profile.jpg`) to the root of this repository.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Locate the `.profile-image-placeholder` div in the `<header>`.
4. Uncomment the `<img>` tag and ensure `src` matches your filename.
5. Remove the `<div id="img-placeholder-text">...</div>`.

### Content
Edit `index.html` to update your resume content.

### Style
Edit `style.css` to change the appearance. The current design is minimal and optimized for readability.
